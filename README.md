# DirPixel

DirPixel is a desktop application that allows you to replace existing images with AI-generated ones based on customizable prompts. Using the power of Pollinations.ai, this tool can generate new images based on text descriptions and save them with the same filenames as your original images.

## Features

- Select a folder containing images to be replaced
- Provide global prompts that apply to all images
- Customize individual prompts for specific images
- Maintain original filenames for seamless replacement
- Support for PNG images (format generated by Pollinations.ai)
- Real-time progress tracking and status updates
- User-friendly graphical interface built with PyQt6

## How It Works

1. Select a folder containing the images you want to replace
2. Enter a global prompt that will be used as a base for all images (optional)
3. Optionally, provide custom prompts for specific images
4. Click "Generate Images" to start the AI generation process
5. Find your new AI-generated images in the `generated_images` subfolder

The application uses [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) to generate images based on your text prompts. Note that Pollinations.ai currently only generates PNG images, so all output files will be in PNG format.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Windows operating system

### Steps

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techcow2/dir-pixel.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dir-pixel
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or install them manually:

   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`
2. Click "Select Folder" and choose the directory containing the images you want to replace
3. (Optional) Enter a global prompt in the "Global Prompt" field that will be applied to all images
4. (Optional) For specific images, double-click in the "Custom Prompt" column to enter unique prompts
5. Click "Generate Images" to start the process
6. View progress in the progress bar and status messages
7. Once complete, find your generated images in the `generated_images` subfolder within your selected directory

### Tips for Better Prompts

- Be descriptive about the style, mood, and content you want
- Include terms like "high quality", "professional", "photorealistic" for better results
- For consistency across images, use similar descriptive terms in your prompts
- Custom prompts for individual images will override the global prompt

## Supported Image Format

- PNG (This is the only format currently supported as it's what Pollinations.ai generates)

## Dependencies

- [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) - For the graphical user interface
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) - For making HTTP requests to the AI service

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. Check that your prompts are in English for best results
3. Verify that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking the application
4. Make sure you have sufficient disk space for the generated images

If the application reports HTTP errors, it might be due to temporary issues with the image generation service. Try again later or modify your prompts slightly.
